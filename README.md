# UdemyLinearRegression

This project was completed as part of a Udemy course. The objective is to decide whether to focus company efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. A linear regression model predicts the yearly amount spent.

Length of membership is by far the strongest indicator of dollars spent. So perhaps digging into why members stay vs churn would yield more insight. The app seems to yield more dollars spent than the website, but is that because of a difference between the platforms or because of a difference between the customers who use the respective platforms? More research should be done before a conclusion is made.
